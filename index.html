      This challenge was presented to me recently: To create a Java web app that can take any form of graph and count the number of adjacent "on" points. In this graph, the "on" points are represented by squares and the "off" points are bullets. The app will return the largest number of connected points.

      If you are unable to access the app, you may need to add this site to your Java "Trusted Sites" list.
